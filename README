SkyCover Duply Web - web interface for SkyCover Duply.

SCDW is created to friendly manage scduply backup configuration on GNU/Linux,
*nix and MS Windows(tm)/CygWin systems.

Initially SCDW is targeted to Windows system administrators, who needs the
mouse-oriented control interfaces and easy way to specify file exclusions on
a filesystem with long complex names like "Documents and Settngs".

SCDW can be executed locally, so you can connect to it via localhost, or itcan
be configured for the network access - via apache-ssl and mod_wsgi.

INSTALLATION

* Windows

Use deploy script sccygwin http://github.com/skycover/sccygwin
It will install cygwin, duplicity, scduply and scdw.
It will prompt you for username and password to access the web interface.

* Linux and others

** Install duplicity.

http://duplicity.nongnu.org

For major Linux distros use package manager.

** Install scduply.

Use Git or Download tarball from http://github.com/skycover/scduply

Extract it somewhere and run install.sh - it will copy scduply to
/usr/local/bin

** Install SCDW

Use Git or Download tarball from http://github.com/skycover/scduply

Extract it in somewhere permanent place (for ex. /usr/local/scdw), "cd" to the
directory and run
install.sh [/path/to/scdw [port]]
By default it will create run script in /usr/local/bin, to listen on the port
8088.
It will also prompt you for username and password to access the web interface.

This will prepare scdw to local start, so you will be able to connect via
localhost.

This way can also be used to connect via network, but it is strongly not
recommended - you should use apache-ssl + mod_wsgi instead.

If you wish to place configs in /etc/scduply instead of /root/.scduply, you
should create an empty /etc/scduply manually before the first run.

INVOCATION

* Windows

Run C:\cygiwin\bin\scdw.cmd and connect to the  port http://localhost:8088/
via the Internet browser.

* Linux and others

Run 
# scdw
and connect to the  port http://localhost:8088/ via the Internet browser.
Or you may run "scdw PORT" to listen another PORT.

* Network access

You can use the above method on the trusted network, but much better is to setup
apache-ssl + mod_wsgi web site.
